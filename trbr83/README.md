It contains two parts: gameover and !gameover. In gameover part, toreset is called if clicked, in !gameover part, other functions are called.toreset()   toreset is also called in the constructor to initialize the game.  This function gives each tile a number 0-5 representing its attributes.    drawtiles()   According to the number allocated in function toreset(), drawtiles function colours the tiles.    drawball()   drawball draws the ball.checklife()   checklife is called when the ball hits the ground. Other than check how many lives are left, it also changes the score and combo.  For unknown reason, the callback way of loadSound supported by p5.js cannot run in class as it did in my original adaptation.
