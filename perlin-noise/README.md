## Example HTML Page ##
```
The example page contains a control panel on the top of the page and a canvas below where the sketch with the particular inputs specified by the control panel is run.

In the control panel each paricle group has a set of 3 sliders to customise the colour for the particles in that particular group.
A box next to the sliders for each group shows the RGB colour that has been created.

There is a slider to control the number of particles for each colour group that increments in a step of 10 (Min: 10, Max: 1000).
There is a slider to control the speed of each particles that increments in a step of 0.1 (Min: 0.1, Max: 3).

There is a Reload button which will take the user inputs and pass them through as parameters to the Sketch class and will then reload the canvas.
